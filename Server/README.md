#Requirement 

1. You need a mongodb ready, with - username, password and database name
2. Database configuration is in ./app/app.js file check lines [12 - 19] 
3. Make sure you username or password doesnt contain '@' (will lead to connection error!)
4. Also if you are using mLab, make sure you create a new "User" for your database
